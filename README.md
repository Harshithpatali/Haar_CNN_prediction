# Haar_CNN_prediction
The goal is to develop a robust prediction/classification model by first denoising and compressing the signal using Haar wavelet transform, and then feeding the transformed features into a CNN to capture spatial and temporal dependencies for accurate classification or regression

# 📈 NIFTY Stock Trend Prediction using Haar Wavelet + CNN/LSTM

This repository contains a set of tools and models to predict **next-day stock market trends** using advanced deep learning techniques like **LSTM** and **CNN**, enhanced with **Haar wavelet transformations** on time series data.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The goal is to accurately predict **uptrend vs. downtrend** for NIFTY stock prices using:

- ✅ **LSTM model** trained on rolling OHLCV windows
- ✅ Optional integration of **Haar wavelet features**
- ✅ Streamlit-based interactive web application
- ✅ Future scope for **CNN**, **CNN+LSTM**, and real-time integration
